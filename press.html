<title>Press - ElDewrito</title>
<meta name="description" content="ElDewrito is a community-made mod for Halo Online, a cancelled free Halo 3 derived PC game for the Russian market. It allows the game to be played in player-hosted servers and aims to restore removed features, fix bugs and glitches, and add mod support. Halo Online was a free-to-play multiplayer shooter developed by Saber Interactive and published by Innova Software, and has since been shut down. The game was only released in Russia, but can be played without region restrictions using ElDewrito. This website is not operated by the ElDewrito developers. ElDewrito was created through the hard work of well known Halo fans, developers and modders like DEElekgolo, Gamecheat13, Lord Zedd and many others. Featuring classic Halo 3 maps like Valhalla and Guardian alongside brand new maps Edge and Reactor with an assortment of community maps on top. ElDewrito can be played for free and is open source, allowing you to contribute to a truly community project.">
